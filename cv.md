## Summary
---
#### After working as a geologist and then later on as an English teacher, at the beginning of 2022, I decided to pursue a career in what I like doing and started learning programming. I've spent about 8 months learning the basics of front-end development and now wish to deepen my knowledge with RS School's course and start my career in this field. I enjoy almost all aspects of web development, especially the constant need for learning and challenging the brain.

### English
#### I've been speaking English since childhood and my university education was 100% in English. I also have a TEFL certificate which allows me to teach English anywhere in the world, and I spent about one year abroad in Russia teaching English in a language school to students of all levels. I mostly speak in English in my daily life as I have a multi-national family.
